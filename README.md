# Understanding microbiome dynamics via interpretable graph representation learning
Large-scale perturbations in the microbiome constitution are strongly correlated, whether as a driver or a consequence, with the health and functioning of human physiology. However, understanding the difference in the microbiome profiles of healthy and ill individuals can be complicated due to the large number of complex interactions among microbes. We propose to model these interactions as a time-evolving graph where nodes represent microbes and edges are interactions among them. Motivated by the need to analyse such complex interactions, we develop a method that can learn a low-dimensional representation of the time-evolving graph while maintaining the dynamics occurring in the high-dimensional space. Through our experiments, we show that we can extract graph features such as clusters of nodes or edges that have the highest impact on the model to learn the low-dimensional representation. This information is crucial for identifying microbes and interactions among them that are strongly correlated with clinical diseases. We conduct our experiments on both synthetic and real-world microbiome datasets.
